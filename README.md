# rk2023-data

This is official election data converted into somewhat more usable JSON formats than presented at [opendata.valimised.ee](https://opendata.valimised.ee/en).

This dataset is mostly a byproduct of a blog post about [digital divide in 2023 election results in Estonia](https://gafgaf.infoaed.ee/en/posts/great-divide-in-evoting/).

There are guerilla open data for Estonian parliament elections [2007](https://github.com/infoaed/rk2007-data/), [2011](https://github.com/infoaed/rk2011-data/), [2015](https://github.com/infoaed/rk2015-data/) amd [2019](https://github.com/infoaed/rk2019-data/).
